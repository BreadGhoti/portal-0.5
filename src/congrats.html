    Thanks for playing our COS426 final project!
    <br/>
    Our goal in this final project was to create a demo of the popular Portal games developed by Valve. Specifically, we hoped to implement the core technical features of the game, including rendering, teleportation, and physics. We hope that our demo captures the experience and enjoyment of playing the actual games. If you're curious about how this demo was written, feel free to check out the code repository and associated writeup at the link in the bottom-right corner.

    Happy 10th Anniversary, Portal 2!
